# Hello Script

So what is Hello Script - in 2008, [@binnyva](https://github.com/binnyva) introduced a new concept for learning languages.

From his blog post - http://www.bin-co.com/blog/2008/03/learning-a-new-programming-language-the-hello-world-method/
> Learning a new programming language is fun â€“ and essential if you want to stay competitive. I try to learn new languages all the time(my latest target is Haskell). As a result, I have a system to make learning new languages easier. This is for people who already know a programming language and want to learn another one.

Recently on a K-MUG.net discussion [@praseedpai](https://github.com/praseedpai) told about this concept, and I wrote a helloscript for PowerShell

Thank you [@Padma Pradeep](https://github.com/developerprofiles) for the PR and associated changes.
